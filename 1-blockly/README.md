# What is blockly?

<img src="..\resources\1-blockly\images\myblockly界面.jpg" />

**blockly** is a completely visual modular programming software and can be used for graphical programming.

**blockly** is similar in functionality and design to MIT's children's programming tool Scratch.

When using **blockly**, users can build code logic by dragging modules. The process is like building blocks.

From the user's perspective, **blockly** is a simple and easy-to-use visual tool for generating code. From a developer's perspective, **blockly** is a text box that contains the code entered by the user.

The process of generating code into the text box is the process of the user dragging in **blockly**.
