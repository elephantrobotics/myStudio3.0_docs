This chapter introduces how to use `blockly` to control the adaptive gripper connected to the `Mercury A1` robotic arm (as shown below)

#### API display

  * We will use the following building blocks

    **1**: `Set Gripper State`: Make the gripper enter the specified state (open or closed) at the specified speed

       Parameter introduction:

       This module has two parameters that can be adjusted:

       * Clamp status parameters: closed state, open state
       * Speed parameter: indicates the speed of rotation, the value range is 0~100
       * Clamp type parameter: Select adaptive gripper here

    

      **2**: `Set Gripper Value`: Make the gripper reach the specified position at the specified speed

       Parameter introduction:

       This module has two parameters that can be adjusted:

       * Clamp value parameter: indicates the position that the clamp will reach, and the value range is 0~100.
       * Speed parameter: indicates the speed of rotation, the value range is 0~100.
       * Clamp type parameter: Select adaptive gripper here







#### Small case

The graphics code is as follows:

<img src="..\resources\1-blockly\images\gripperUse\code.png" style="zoom: 80%;" />



The execution effect of the code:

- Control the adaptive gripper to open at a speed of 20

- Wait 5 seconds
- Control the adaptive gripper to reach the position with a value of 80 at a speed of 20
- Wait 5 seconds
- Control the adaptive gripper to reach the position with a value of 20 at a speed of 20
- Wait 5 seconds
- Close the jaws



**Notice**:

If you are unable to control the gripper from the example above, perhaps you need to set the gripper mode to `Transparent Transmission`

After setting it up, then run the small case code again.
