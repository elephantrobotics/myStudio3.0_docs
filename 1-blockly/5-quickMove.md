What is **Quick Movement**? To put it simply, no programming is required, and the robot can be quickly controlled by mouse clicks.

> Note: There are two **Quick Move** control panels in myStudio, and their functions are not much different.

**Step 1:** Click the **Quick Move** button to open the **Quick Move** panel and wait for the robot data to be returned.

If no data is all zero, please check whether the robotic arm is connected and whether the robotic arm is normal.

**Step 2:** Try clicking the `-` / `+` buttons to control different joints of the robotic arm.

**Step 3:** Control coordinates.

First, you need to move joint 4 to a position of about -90, as shown below.

Then you can click the `-` / `+` buttons of different coordinate axes to control the coordinates
