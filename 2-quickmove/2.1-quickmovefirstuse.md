| 1    | Mercury A1 model diagram          |
| 2    | The bottom IO pin numbers 1-6 are input and belong to the security module detection items                    |
| 3    | Bottom IO pin numbers 1-6, output, you can click the switch button to set the output         |
| 4    | End IO pin number 1-2, input, belongs to the security module detection item  |
| 5    | End IO pin number 1-2, output, used to control the adaptive gripper |
| 6    | Turn on free movement mode                 |
| 7    | Exit quick movement interface                     |
| 8    | Angle control, click the `+` `-` button to control the joint angle of the robot arm. The value represents the joint angle information of the current robot arm. You can also modify the value directly for joint control   |
| 9    | Coordinate control, by clicking the `+` `-` button, coordinate control of the robotic arm. The value represents the current coordinate attitude information of the robotic arm. You can also modify the value directly for coordinate control |
| 10   | Set the movement speed of the robot arm, the default is 10 mm/s                |
| 11   | Angle step, the angle value that increases or decreases each time when adjusting the angle                     |
| 12   | Coordinate step size, the coordinate value that increases or decreases each time when adjusting the coordinate posture              |
| 13   | Turn on continuous movement mode             |
| 14   | Safety module that detects robot status in real time              |

## 2 Angle control

In the angle control area, click the `+` `-` button to control the joint angle of the robotic arm. The value represents the joint angle information of the current robotic arm. You can also modify the value directly for joint control.

## 4 Free movement

Open the free movement mode by clicking the `free move` button. The color of the button will turn green, and the LED light panel at the end of the machine will turn yellow, indicating that the machine is in free movement mode. At this time, you can press and hold the end LED light panel to operate the machine. Drag to move.

When the `Free Move` button is in the green state, clicking the button again means turning off the free move mode. At this time, the button color turns gray and the LED light panel at the end of the machine turns green.

## 5 Continuous movement

Turn on continuous movement mode by clicking the `Continuous Movement` button, which changes color to green. You can control the robot to continuously move at a specified angle by **long pressing** the `+` `-` button in the corresponding area, or control the robot to continue to move according to the specified coordinates or attitude value.

When the `continuous movement` button is in the green state, clicking the button again means turning off the continuous movement mode, and the button color turns gray.

**Note:** `+` `-` After each **long press** of the button for 3 seconds, you need to release the button, **long press** again, and then continue to operate and move continuously.

## 6 IO control

### 6.1 Bottom IO

Set the bottom IO pin number 1-6 output, the user can customize the control actuator. For example, you can customize the control of the gripper and suction pump.
