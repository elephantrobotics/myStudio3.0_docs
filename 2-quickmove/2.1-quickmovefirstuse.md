# Quick Move

*before the start*

> *1. Make sure the machine is powered on*
>
> *2. Make sure the machine connection and communication are normal*
>
> *3. Make sure the machine is in zero position*

## 2 Angle control

In the angle control area, click the `+` `-` button to control the joint angle of the robotic arm. The value represents the joint angle information of the current robotic arm. You can also modify the value directly for joint control.

## 3 Coordinate control

Before using coordinate control, you need to move `Joint 4` to an angle position of about `-90`.

## 4 Free movement

Open the free movement mode by clicking the `freeMove` button. The color of the button will turn green, and the LED light panel at the end of the machine will turn yellow, indicating that the machine is in free movement mode. At this time, you can press and hold the end LED light panel to operate the machine. Drag to move.

When the `freeMove` button is in the green state, clicking the button again means turning off the free move mode. At this time, the button color turns gray and the LED light panel at the end of the machine turns green.

## 5 Continuous movement

Turn on continuous movement mode by clicking the `Continue Move` button, which changes color to green. You can control the robot to continuously move at a specified angle by **long pressing** the `+` `-` button in the corresponding area, or control the robot to continue to move according to the specified coordinates or attitude value.

When the `Continue Move` button is in the green state, clicking the button again means turning off the continuous movement mode, and the button color turns gray.

**Note:** `+` `-` After each **long press** of the button for 3 seconds, you need to release the button, **long press** again, and then continue to operate and move continuously.

## 6 IO control

### 6.1 Bottom IO

Set the bottom IO pin number 1-6 output, the user can customize the control actuator. For example, you can customize the control of the gripper and suction pump.
